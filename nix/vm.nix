# This derivation generates a QEMU VM.
# It's probably very hacky because I threw this together as I needed it. I
# never took the time to properly read and understand the QEMU documentation.
# This can be run with the "lions-vm" command, which is declared in
# "shell.nix".
# The VM tries to be as close to the production server ("server.nix") as
# possible. It also uses SOPS but only includes dummy secrets. It doesn't use
# litestream since it can't connect to AWS and in any case it wouldn't make
# sense to back up the VM DB since it starts with seed data and any changes
# should be ephemeral.
